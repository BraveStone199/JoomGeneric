JoomGeneric
===========

Recoded McGeneric Template to work with Joomla. This template supports all core Joomla components and modules. It also supports the Joomla Discussions plugin developed by [CodingFish](codingfish.com).

##Instalation

1. Download the .zip version of the entire repository.
2. Upload that compressed folder to your Joomla Website as an Extension.
3. You should get a success message if everything works properly.

## Template Options

You can customize a couple of features so far in this template.
 - **Title** You can customize the title of the website in this field. The title will be completely Capitalized in a Minecraft themed font.
 - **SubTitle** You can also customize a tagline for your server or website here. This will be displayed in the same font as the title just smaller.
 - **Background** The image background is a tiled texture. You can pick to use either the dark stone background (default) or the dirt background.
 

Let me know if there are any features you would like added and I will make an effort to get to them.
